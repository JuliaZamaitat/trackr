# trackr

This is a project using the MEVN stack with Vue 3 and Typescript.

The client and the server need to be handled seperately â€“ each directory has its own package and scripts and needs to be started separately.


## Project setup
```
cd client & npm install
cd server & npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
cd client & npm run serve
cd server & npm start
```
